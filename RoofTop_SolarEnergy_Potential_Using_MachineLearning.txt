1. Define Objectives:

Main Objective: Develop a machine learning model that predicts rooftop solar energy generation and visualize results through comprehensive graphs and statistics.
Secondary Objectives: Understand key factors affecting solar power generation, such as weather conditions, and provide insights through visualizations.

2. Team Assignment:

If you're working with a team (3-4 members), we can assign roles:

Data Engineer: Handles data collection, cleaning, and preprocessing.
ML Engineer: Focuses on model development, testing, and optimization.
Visualization Expert: Works on creating graphs and dashboard visualizations.
Project Coordinator (you): Oversees the entire workflow and makes final decisions.

3. Data Collection (Timeframe: 1 Week)

Task: Collect historical data for rooftop solar energy generation.
Sources:
NASA’s POWER Project
NREL’s National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB)
Local meteorological departments for regional weather data (temperature, humidity, etc.).
Solar panel performance data from local solar systems or public datasets.
Team Assignment: The Data Engineer will gather and prepare the dataset, ensuring consistency and filling missing data.

4. Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering (Timeframe: 1 Week)
Task:

Handle missing values and outliers.
Perform feature scaling and normalization.
Time-series splitting (train, validation, and test sets).
Create additional features like day length, sunlight hours, etc.
Team Assignment: The ML Engineer and Data Engineer will collaborate to create clean, meaningful input features for the model.

5. Model Development (Timeframe: 2 Weeks)
Task:

Try different algorithms: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, LSTM (if time-series is significant).
Evaluate models with appropriate metrics (MAE, RMSE, etc.).
Steps:

Start with simple models like Linear Regression to create a baseline.
Tune hyperparameters for more complex models (e.g., Decision Trees, XGBoost).
If data is time-sensitive, use LSTM for sequence prediction.
Team Assignment: The ML Engineer will experiment with different models and optimize their performance.

6. Visualization & Insights (Timeframe: 1 Week)

Task: Visualize the predictions, error metrics, and important features affecting predictions.

Graphs:

Line graph: Predicted vs. Actual solar energy over time.
Heatmaps: Solar generation intensity at different times of the day/year.
Correlation matrix: How features like temperature, humidity, and solar irradiance affect energy generation.
Tools: Use Matplotlib, Seaborn for static graphs, and Plotly or Dash for interactive, web-based visualizations.

Team Assignment: The Visualization Expert will create insightful, easy-to-understand visualizations for the project.

7. Model Deployment and Dashboard (Optional if Time Permits)

Task: Develop a simple dashboard using Streamlit or Dash to allow users to see real-time solar energy predictions.

Include a model-prediction section and graphical visualizations in the dashboard.
Team Assignment: The Visualization Expert with the ML Engineer can work on this optional feature.

8. Final Report & Presentation (Timeframe: 1 Week)

Task: Compile all results, including:

Data collection process.
Model development steps and results.
Visualizations and key insights.
Create a PowerPoint or document summarizing the project for evaluation or submission.

Team Assignment: The Project Coordinator (you) will lead the report writing and ensure that the work is comprehensive and meets project goals.

9. Timeline:

Week 1: Data collection and preprocessing.
Week 2: Model experimentation and feature engineering.
Week 3: Model evaluation and visualization.
Week 4: Dashboard creation (optional) and final reporting.
Tools & Technologies:
Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras for LSTM, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly).
Jupyter Notebooks for coding.
Streamlit or Dash for interactive visualizations (optional).
