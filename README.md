## Features

- Interactive UI for predicting solar energy output based on user-defined inputs like temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.
- Machine Learning Models for accurate predictions using historical data.
- Visualization Dashboard displaying model performance metrics and feature importance.
- Correlation Heatmaps to explore feature relationships.
- Outlier Detection using box plots.
- Actual vs Predicted energy output comparisons.
- Seasonal Decomposition to visualize patterns in energy production and weather parameters.

## Modeling Approach

This project involves training and evaluating multiple machine learning models to predict solar radiation output based on meteorological features:

### Models Used:
- XGBoost
- Gradient Boosting
- Random Forest
- Decision Tree
- Linear Regression

### Model Evaluation Metrics:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- RÂ² Score

The best-performing model is then deployed in the Streamlit app for real-time predictions.

## Visualizations

We employ Plotly to create interactive visualizations, such as:

- **Feature Distributions**: Histograms and box plots for features like temperature, humidity, and pressure.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Heatmaps and bar charts showing feature correlations with solar radiation.
- **Scatter Plots**: Comparing actual vs predicted values for radiation.
- **Seasonal Decomposition**: Visualizing the trend, seasonality, and residuals for energy output and weather parameters.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python, Streamlit
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- **Visualization**: Plotly, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- **Deployment**: Streamlit Cloud, GitHub
